 * @dev A modifier that defines a protected reinitializer function that can be invoked at most once, and only if the
     * contract hasn't been initialized to a greater version before. In its scope, `onlyInitializing` functions can be
     * used to initialize parent contracts.
     *
     * A reinitializer may be used after the original initialization step. This is essential to configure modules that
     * are added through upgrades and that require initialization.
     *
     * When `version` is 1, this modifier is similar to `initializer`, except that functions marked with `reinitializer`
     * cannot be nested. If one is invoked in the context of another, execution will revert.
     *
     * Note that versions can jump in increments greater than 1; this implies that if multiple reinitializers coexist in
     * a contract, executing them in the right order is up to the developer or operator.
     *
     * WARNING: setting the version to 255 will prevent any future reinitialization.
     *
     * Emits an {Initialized} event.
